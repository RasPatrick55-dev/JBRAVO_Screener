This repository contains a sample workflow for a swing trading automation project.

The `dashboards/dashboard_app.py` file implements a full-featured monitoring
dashboard built with Plotly Dash.  It visualizes trade performance, recent
pipeline runs and multiple log files.  Example CSVs and logs can be found under
`data/` and `logs/`.

To launch the dashboard locally run:

```
python dashboards/dashboard_app.py
```
