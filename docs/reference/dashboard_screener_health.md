# Dashboard Screener Health Reference

The dashboard consistency checker validates that the Screener Health dashboard reflects the latest pipeline and executor artifacts. It performs lightweight instrumentation so operators can confirm every KPI aligns with underlying files and DB-backed artifacts.

## Running The Checker

```bash
python -m scripts.dashboard_consistency_check
```

The command emits artifacts under `reports/` (or `--reports-dir`):

- `dashboard_consistency.json`: machine-readable check payload.
- `dashboard_kpis.csv`: flattened KPIs for dashboard consumption.
- `dashboard_findings.txt`: human-readable summary.
- `docs_findings.txt`: docs consistency report generated by `scripts.docs_consistency_check`.

## What Is Validated

- Recent timestamps from `screener_metrics.json`, `metrics_summary.csv`, and pipeline markers.
- Universe coverage (`symbols_in`, `symbols_with_bars`, and bar totals).
- Candidate output health with DB-first assumptions and canonical CSV header checks.
- Gate pressure and stage timing fields.
- Pipeline tokens: `PIPELINE_START`, `PIPELINE_SUMMARY`, `FALLBACK_CHECK`, `PIPELINE_END`, `DASH RELOAD`.
- Executor summary (submitted/filled/canceled/trailing) and skip reasons.
- Trades log presence behavior.
- Prediction/decile artifacts when present.
- Prefix guard sanity checks.

Missing artifacts are tolerated: the checker marks them as absent without crashing so zero-candidate and first-run mornings still render.

## Paper-Only Indicators

The dashboard highlights paper-only environments with a badge. Screener Health should remain consistent with paper execution artifacts and non-authoritative CSV exports.

## Operator Checklist

1. Last run timestamps in the dashboard should match `dashboard_findings.txt`.
2. Candidate state should match DB-backed latest views and checker row counts.
3. Pipeline marker ordering should match the checker's token sequence.
4. Missing execution artifacts on paper mornings should render as zero/empty state, not hard errors.
5. `reports/docs_findings.txt` should report `DOCS_CONSISTENCY status=PASS`.
