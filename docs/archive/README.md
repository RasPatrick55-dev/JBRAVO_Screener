# Docs Archive

This folder is for superseded docs/assets kept for historical traceability.

## Architecture PDFs/TXT

- No `*.pdf` or `*.txt` architecture docs are currently tracked in this repository snapshot.
- If legacy architecture PDFs/TXT are reintroduced, move them here and keep this banner in place.

## Archive Rule

When a doc conflicts with `docs/AI_CONTEXT.md` or current CLI behavior, archive it instead of leaving it in active reference paths.
